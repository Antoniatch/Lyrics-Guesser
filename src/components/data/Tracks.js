        lyric: "To the left, to the left, everything you own in the bow to the left, in the closet, that's my stuff, yes, if I bought it, please don't touch, and keep talking that mess that's fine, But could you walk and talk at the same time? And, it's my name that's on that Jag, So remove your bags, let me call you a cab, Standing in the front you're telling me how I'm such a fool, talking 'bout how I'll never find a man like you, you got me twisted"
